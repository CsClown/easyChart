# User Experience (UX)

## Wireframes

The wireframes for easyChart were produced in [Figma](https://figma.com). There are frames for a full width display and a small mobile device. The final site varies from the wireframes due to developments that occurred during the creation process.

## Site Structure

The easyChart website needs only one page. Its an one-trick-pony and doesnt pretend otherwise.<br><br>
You got four sections:

- Set the title
- Set the Data
- Choose the chart style
- Chart canvas
